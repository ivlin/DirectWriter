DW NOTE: I Need more information, how exactly will you be making file operations easier?

Group Members: Ivan Lin

Description of Project:
This will be a tool to assist in file management. 

There will be a text file that maps out all of the subdirectories and files in a directory. (Similar to the sidebar on windows explorer). Any changes users make to the text will be performed on the actual file. For example, if the user changes the name of a directory in the text file, the actual file's name will also be changed. Or, if a user deletes a line from the file containing the name of  a file or directory, the actual file or directory will be deleted. This would require a tracking system of which lines are edited, which lines are added, and which lines are removed.

Expansion Plans:

A possible addition would be to offer an alternative to regex and patterns. Instead of writing out a pattern, there will be questions, user prompts, and input fields users can answer to find specific files. There will be options to create folders and automatically move and organize files. Options will include: sorting, renaming, deleting, and creating files and directories.

Possibly a GUI version
